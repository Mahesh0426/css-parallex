              Parallax is a technique in web design where background images move
              at a different speed than foreground content while scrolling,
              creating a sense of depth and immersion.This effect is achieved
              using CSS and JavaScript, enhancing visual interest and
              interactivity on websites. It adds a dynamic, engaging element to
              user experience.
